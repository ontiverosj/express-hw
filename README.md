there alot of things I can do the node packeage they are smaller functions of code to help with funcstions that are either on the back end or front end 
With doing reseach on express and nderstanding more as I go. I undsertand that the express has a Middleware which code can take place and in the code its sending a request and a reponse varibale that the middleware is sending to the server. So when I think of that I can put anything inside this code. on the other side is I feel like I also dont know enought to know what that is. 
I think that with express come updated codes that Meter.js with I have read up on that is a more modern dev. it has the capasity to sercis large projects like reaction commerce work more the the buiness side of things, there are js packages that work with express. (nest.js) some are running code with generate a libray full of blue prints with out even writing any codes. 
I have really had a chance to do hosting on another platfrom other then the basic github and Gitlab I like is really cool inasense of looking at what I am doing in reall time and fixing it on the spot and finding out where the answers. It helps me learn about what I am working on. I do have to say I like React better just becase it give you a place on the website as to why things are not working.
